Role: ICSID provides facilities for the conciliation and arbitration of investment disputes between foreign investors and host states. This means that if a company from one country invests in another country and a dispute arises (e.g., over changes in regulations, expropriation of assets), the investor can bring a case against the host state at ICSID.

Relevance to Natural Resources: A significant number of ICSID cases involve disputes related to natural resources, including:

Mining
Oil and gas
Forestry
Water management
ISDS (Investor-State Dispute Settlement): This is the broader term for the mechanism that allows foreign investors to sue host states in international arbitration. ICSID is one of the most prominent venues for ISDS cases.

Key Features of ICSID:

Arbitration: ICSID primarily uses arbitration to resolve disputes. This is a process where a neutral tribunal hears both sides of the case and makes a binding decision.
Consent-based: A state must consent to ICSID jurisdiction, usually through a bilateral investment treaty (BIT) or a provision in an investment contract.
Enforcement of Awards: ICSID awards are generally enforceable in the courts of member states.
Why ICSID is Relevant to Natural Resources:

Many foreign investments in developing countries involve the extraction or exploitation of natural resources. These investments are often protected by BITs, which include provisions for ISDS through ICSID. If a host state takes actions that negatively affect a foreign investor's rights under the BIT (e.g., by changing regulations or nationalizing assets), the investor can initiate arbitration at ICSID.

In summary:

ICSID is a crucial institution in the field of international investment law, particularly in the context of natural resources. It provides a forum for resolving disputes between foreign investors and host states through arbitration. ISDS is the general mechanism that allows for such disputes, and ICSID is a prominent venue for these cases.
