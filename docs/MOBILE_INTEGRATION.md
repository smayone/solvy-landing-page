# SOLVY Mobile Integration Guide

## Overview
This guide outlines how SOLVY's mobile applications (iOS and Android) integrate with the main web platform.

## Repository Structure
SOLVY platform is split into three main repositories:
1. SOLVY Web (Current Repository)
   - Web application
   - Core API services
   - Documentation
   - Smart contracts

2. SOLVY iOS (Separate Repository)
   - Native Swift/SwiftUI implementation
   - iOS-specific features
   - App Store deployment configs
   - iOS SDK implementation

3. SOLVY Android (Separate Repository)
   - Native Kotlin/Jetpack Compose implementation
   - Android-specific features
   - Play Store configurations
   - Android SDK implementation

## Shared Components
### API Integration
Both mobile apps will integrate with the same backend API endpoints used by the web application:
- Authentication endpoints
- Payment processing
- Blockchain interactions
- Data synchronization

### Common Features
1. Wallet Integration
   - Web3 wallet connections
   - Transaction signing
   - Balance management

2. Payment Processing
   - Stripe SDK integration
   - Crypto onramp functionality
   - Payment status tracking

3. Identity Management
   - Self-sovereign identity
   - Multi-factor authentication
   - Biometric authentication (mobile-specific)

## Mobile-Specific Enhancements
1. iOS Features
   - Face ID/Touch ID integration
   - Apple Pay support
   - iCloud keychain integration
   - Widget support
   - Apple Watch companion app

2. Android Features
   - Fingerprint authentication
   - Google Pay integration
   - Android keystore integration
   - Home screen widgets
   - Wear OS support

## Development Setup
### Prerequisites
1. iOS Development
   - macOS Sonoma or later
   - Xcode 15+
   - iOS 15.0+ deployment target
   - CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager

2. Android Development
   - Android Studio Electric Eel or newer
   - Android SDK 33+
   - Gradle 8.0+
   - Kotlin 1.9+

## Getting Started
1. Clone the appropriate mobile repository
2. Set up environment variables
3. Install dependencies
4. Configure API endpoints
5. Run the development build

## Best Practices
1. Maintain API Consistency
   - Use the same API endpoints across platforms
   - Share API response types
   - Maintain consistent error handling

2. Authentication Flow
   - Implement secure token storage
   - Handle biometric authentication
   - Manage session persistence

3. Testing Strategy
   - Unit tests for business logic
   - UI tests for critical flows
   - Integration tests with backend services

## Deployment
1. iOS
   - TestFlight for beta testing
   - App Store submission process
   - Certificate management

2. Android
   - Internal testing track
   - Play Store deployment
   - Signing key management

## Future Considerations
1. Cross-Platform Components
   - Shared business logic
   - Common UI components
   - Unified testing strategy

2. Feature Parity
   - Maintain consistent features across platforms
   - Platform-specific optimizations
   - Regular synchronization of capabilities

3. Performance Monitoring
   - Analytics integration
   - Crash reporting
   - User feedback collection
